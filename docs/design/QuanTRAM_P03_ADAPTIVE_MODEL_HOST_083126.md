# QuanTRAM P-03 Adaptive Model Host — Design

**Date:** August 31, 2026  
**Last updated:** September 2, 2026  
**Status:** Scientific port (Phases A–C), model-consumer path (D0), live host (D), and `ModelService.StreamDecisions` (E) are complete in-process (1 Sep). Default `QUANTRAM_MODEL=off`. Live IEX DecisionEvents observed 1 Sep. Adaptive Pipeline viewer is in `quantram-dashboard` (copied proto). P-04 PriceEngine/EXPM Phases A–I landed 2 Sep (default `QUANTRAM_PRICING=off`).  
**Scope:** Collocated Go adaptive host that consumes P-02 finalized bars.  
**Parents:** [Process Model](QuanTRAM_PROCESS_MODEL_082926.md), [P-02 Data Quality](QuanTRAM_INGESTION_P02_DATA_QUALITY_083126.md)  
**Review:** [P03_feedback_083126.md](../../P03_feedback_083126.md) (incorporated 31 Aug)  
**Scientific source:** `C:\Users\chino\SADE` (Python Adaptive Pipeline D01 → D02 → D04 → emitter)  
**Language evidence:** [SADE Go refactorability investigation, 2026-08-27](file:///C:/Users/chino/SADE/docs/investigations/SADE_GO_REFACTORABILITY_AND_SCALED_RUNTIME_INVESTIGATION_2026-08-27.md)  
**Implementation plan:** [P-03 Implementation](QuanTRAM_P03_IMPLEMENTATION_083126.md) · [P-04 Price Engine](QuanTRAM_P04_PRICE_ENGINE_090226.md)

## 1. Purpose

P-03 is the next QuanTRAM process after the P-02 data gate. It turns a **finalized, quality-eligible 1-minute bar** into exactly one **DecisionEvent**: a BUY/SELL/HOLD decision or a typed skip. It never sends orders. D01 is recursive, so a silently dropped bar is a permanently wrong state trajectory, not a missed tick.

This increment implements the **adaptive** scientific path in Go inside QuanTRAM. It does **not** reconnect SADE to SDX, and it does **not** stand up a Python sidecar for the adaptive model.

## 2. What SADE is today (authoritative for science, not for live ingress)

SADE V0.1 is a Python package. The live product path is:

```text

        │

        ├─ D02 build_return_shape
        ├─ D04 CapturabilityModelV0_2
        └─ rolling-15 context → BUY / SELL / HOLD or INITIALIZING
```

Validated offline baseline: SADE Unit Run 001, AAPL, 100 vectors, outputs under `SADE/output/unit_runs/001/`.

### 2.1 Scientific lineage (roadmap, not “two finished products”)

| Site | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **APTF** | Experimental site. Equations, experiments, and the original Python were developed there. |
| **SADE** | Take **proved** APTF code into a product runtime. The lift is **not complete**. |
| **QuanTRAM P-03+** | Same proved science, live bars from P-02, Go-dominant runtime. |

The intended product decision is **not** adaptive BUY/SELL/HOLD alone. The roadmap is:

**Adaptive model + PriceEngine, with the PriceEngine decision on analytic EXPM trajectories.**

SADE already closed Finding 001: production `solve_cover` is `scipy.linalg.expm` (`sade/pricing_pipeline/projection.py`). Frozen RK45 is `solve_cover_rk45_reference` — validation only. The 11-point `[0,1]` minute cover (`projected_*`, `domain_exit`, success → GREEN/RED/AMBER) is unchanged; only the solver that produces the samples changed.

**Go production = EXPM only.** Do not port RK45 into the Go runtime and do not wire a Python RK45 function. Frozen Python RK45 remains **outside** QuanTRAM as the Gold Nugget validation oracle.

**RK45 provenance (oracle only):** the original implementation is APTF `diagnostics/run_test_013b_qqq_validation.py::solve_cover`. SADE `sade/pricing_pipeline/projection.py` records that lineage; `solve_cover_rk45_reference()` is the migrated, frozen copy of that mathematics. Future Go EXPM validation uses the **SADE** frozen reference (`projection.py::solve_cover_rk45_reference`) plus the Python EXPM production path. QuanTRAM / SADE_GO must **not** depend on the historical APTF repository.

A later pricing increment implements EXPM faithfully and proves it against (1) SADE production `solve_cover` (EXPM) and (2) SADE `solve_cover_rk45_reference`. After that gate, the deployed Go system contains only EXPM.

**`time_term` contract (do not generalize):** Python EXPM is valid only for the production case `time_term == false` and raises `ANALYTIC_TIME_TERM_UNSUPPORTED` when `time_term == true` (that branch is explicitly time-varying). Go must reject the same case. Do not silently accept or invent a time-varying EXPM.

Finding 001 already compared EXPM to frozen RK45 over **55 solves / 605 trajectory points**. Differences were tiny (max abs `p` `1.62e-08`, `p1` `9.31e-09`, `p2` `5.34e-09`; max relative error about `2.4e-05` on `p2`). Downstream scientific behavior matched: domain exit, first exit, exit dimension, `D_local_maximum`, PriceEmission, PolicyState, and cockpit outputs. That is why EXPM was promoted to production and RK45 was retained only as the reference oracle.

This P-03 increment still ports only the adaptive emitter. It must not treat “adaptive and pricing are separate forever” as design intent. The earlier note that EXPM was merely a candidate accelerator, and that Go should call Python RK45, is **superseded**.

## 3. Decisions for QuanTRAM

| Topic | Decision |
| :--- | :--- |
| Live input | **P-02 model-consumer path only** (not the lossy observe `SubscribeFinalized`). Eligible: finalized, `COMPLETE`, not backfilled, per-symbol adjacency, and the Phase 0 `infer` policy in §5.4. |
| SDX / SADE `sdx_client` | **Do not use** on the live path. SDX remains an offline CSV tool in another repo. |
| Adaptive mathematics | **Go black box** in this process (`internal/adaptive`). Stdlib scalar math; no NumPy/SciPy on this path. |
| Python adaptive wrapper / `ModelInferenceService.Predict` | **Not required** for adaptive. A stateful Python wrapper is strictly worse (affinity + serialize-every-bar). Amends process-model P-04 for this increment. |
| Pricing / EXPM | **P-04 (design 2 Sep).** PriceEngine on Go EXPM (`time_term == false` only), sibling on the accepted bar. Oracle: SADE `solve_cover_rk45_reference`. See [P-04 Price Engine](QuanTRAM_P04_PRICE_ENGINE_090226.md). |
| Persistence of bars | Still not required. P-03 holds **per-symbol scientific state** only (D01 runtime + 15-context). |
| CSV in QuanTRAM | Allowed only as an **offline equivalence harness** that maps rows into `domain.Bar` and calls the same Go engine. |
| Orders / risk | Out of scope. `DecisionEvent` is the stop line. Emitter LONG/SHORT is `emitter_position_state` (scientific context), not an account position. |

Process-model amendment: P-03 **owns** the proved adaptive path in Go. P-04 is PriceEngine on **Go EXPM** (same `time_term == false` contract as SADE production `solve_cover`). Do not implement `ModelInferenceService`. Do not carry RK45 into Go. Design: [P-04](QuanTRAM_P04_PRICE_ENGINE_090226.md).

## 4. Runtime topology (local Phase 0)

```text
P-01 Alpaca ──► P-02 pipeline
                    │
                    │ FinalizedBarConsumer (model path; no silent drop)
                    │ observe/dashboard stream remains lossy and separate
                    ▼
              P-03 Model Host
                    │  one keyed worker per symbol (no concurrent Step)
                    │  AdaptiveEngine transactional Step
                    ▼
              DecisionEvent  (decision | typed skip)
                    │
                    ✗  not connected to P-05 / P-06 in this increment
```

Collocation rule: P-03 calls P-02 through a **Go interface**, not loopback gRPC. Proto types stay in `internal/server` and are added only after domain events are frozen.

Symbols are independent. One owner/worker per symbol: no concurrent `Step` on the same symbol; a slow symbol must not consume another symbol’s deadline. Do not share D01 state across symbols.

## 5. Input contract (P-02 → P-03)

P-03 may **commit** an engine step only when **all** of these hold:

1. The bar arrived on the **model** finalized path (`is_final=true`).
2. The Phase 0 `infer` policy in §5.4 allows evaluation.
3. `bar.ModelEligible()` — `COMPLETE`, not backfilled.
4. Per-symbol `IntervalStart` is **strictly after** the last accepted step, minute-aligned. A delta greater than one minute is a **valid irregular interval** unless there is independent evidence of required observation loss (queue overflow, panic, or a proven missing eligible bar). Do not synthesize a flat bar for the omitted minute.

Otherwise emit a typed skip and leave scientific state unchanged. Do not reuse a previous decision as if it were new (OP-05).

The Next.js viewer remains on the **observe** stream. It is not the P-03 input.

### 5.1 Finalized delivery guarantees (critical)

`Pipeline.SubscribeFinalized` today is a depth-2 **drop-oldest** fan-out. Clearing `infer` only happens if the *second* send also fails. That is acceptable for a viewer. It is **not** acceptable for recursive D01: evaluating N+2 without N+1 changes every later state.

Phase 0 P-03 must use a distinct consumer (names follow repo style):

```text
FinalizedBarConsumer
  SubscribeModelBars(buffer)  // model contract, not observe
  Unsubscribe
  ReadinessFor(symbol)        // Phase 0 may still consult global infer; see §5.4
  Window(symbol, limit)
```

Required behavior:

- Never **silently** drop an eligible finalized bar destined for P-03.
- Each accepted step implies a per-symbol expected next `IntervalStart` (last + 1 minute).
- Overflow, a missing minute, or a non-adjacent interval marks that symbol **discontinuous**.
- While discontinuous, P-03 must not evaluate later bars for that symbol until an explicit reset (Phase 0) or a later documented rebuild.
- A small blocking mailbox at 1-minute cadence is allowed if it is isolated from the WebSocket reader and bounded by the 200 ms host deadline.
- The observe/dashboard stream may stay best-effort.

Acceptance: stall the P-03 consumer, publish three finalized bars into a depth-2 transport, and prove either all three are processed in order **or** the symbol enters a named discontinuous/gated state before any later bar is evaluated.

P-02 observe `Subscribe` / `SubscribeFinalized` may remain lossy. Do not wire the live host to that path.

### 5.2 Startup and rebuild (Phase 0: cold start)

`SubscribeFinalized` does not replay the current window. **Phase 0 mode is cold start:**

- Subscribe first; ignore historical window contents.
- Initialize only from newly finalized eligible bars.
- Report `INITIALIZING n/16` (15 context bars, first ACTIONABLE on the 16th accepted eligible step).
- Every process restart resets all model state and repeats warm-up.
- Host restart is **not** treated as a new market session (no calendar; see §8.1).

Deterministic rebuild (subscribe, watermark, finalized window, overlap dedup, then live) is **deferred**. Do not seed from reconstructed bars for live evaluation. Do not leave the mode implicit: health must show `cold`.

### 5.3 Field map: `domain.Bar` → observation

D01’s scientific inputs are **close, volume, and model event time**. Open/high/low stay on provenance; they do not enter the D01 step.

**Canonical event time is `Bar.IntervalStart`** (already UTC, used by P-02 for order, continuity, and dedup). Do not reparse `SourceTimestamp` for D01. Keep `SourceTimestamp` on the DecisionEvent for provenance only. The offline fixture adapter builds `IntervalStart` from the frozen CSV timestamp before the same mapper.

| SADE field | QuanTRAM source | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `entity_id` | `Bar.Symbol` | Uppercase ticker. |
| `event_time` | `Bar.IntervalStart` as UTC unix seconds | Not `SourceTimestamp`. |
| `receive_time` | `Bar.ReceiptTime` | Operational only. Must not enter D01 equations. |
| `sequence_id` | per-symbol count of **accepted** committed steps, starting at 0 | Replaces SDX `source_row_index`. |
| `price` | `Bar.Close` | Same as `SourceRowNormalizer`. |
| `volume` | `Bar.Volume` as float64 | Reject if conversion is non-finite. |
| `session` | `"UNKNOWN"` | Placeholder until DI-04. |
| `source_quality` | `1.0` when model-eligible | P-02 already gated. |
| `bid` / `ask` | nil | Unchanged. |

`data_valid=true` in SADE was an input assumption. P-02 eligibility replaces it.

### 5.4 Per-symbol vs global `infer` (Phase 0: global)

P-02 `Readiness().Infer` is **global**: every configured symbol must have a contiguous complete live head. One stale name pauses AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA together.

**Phase 0:** keep that global gate. Document it: one symbol failing continuity **pauses evaluation for all engines**; scientific state is **not** reset. Add a test that proves pause-not-reset.

**Intended evolution:** `ReadinessFor(symbol)` so engines fail and recover independently. Do not implement per-symbol infer in P-02 as a silent change without tests.

### 5.5 Engine input/output validation

At the P-03 boundary, after P-02 checks, still reject and skip (`INVALID_INPUT` or `ENGINE_ERROR`) with **no commit** if:

- close/volume/derived values are non-finite
- `IntervalStart` does not advance, or `dt` is `<= 0` after the first step
- half-life or H / Q_G / Q_S / Q_R / C is non-finite or outside its documented domain
- confidence is outside `[0, 1]`

Do not invent a maximum stock price. Validate mathematical domains and float safety only.

### 5.6 `physical_row` and `source_row_index`

SADE hashes `physical_row` into `observation_id` and passes `physical_row - 2` as `sequence_id`. That `+2` is a **CSV / frozen-emitter compatibility shim**, not market physics.

| Mode | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| Live P-02 | `sequence_id` = accepted-step index. Identity for provenance is `market_snapshot_id` plus symbol and `interval_start`. Do not require CSV row numbers. |
| Offline equivalence vs Unit Run 001 | Apply `physical_row = source_row_index + 2` **only** so SHA-256 `observation_id` can be compared to the frozen Python run. |

## 6. Scientific box (what to port)

Port the **equations and operation order**, not the Python package layout or the unbounded diagnostics.

| SADE module | Role | Go notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `d01/v02/*` (23 files) | Markovian state update | No window. One `RuntimeState` per symbol. |
| `d02/v02` | Return shape from DMO/FMO | 8 forward samples. |
| `d04` capturability | H, Q_G, Q_S, Q_R, C | `structural_quality` must be `Pow(x, 1.0/3.0)`, **not** `Cbrt`. |
| `adaptive_emitter` | 15-deque, decision predicate, `emitter_position_state` LONG/SHORT | `CONTEXT_LENGTH = 15`. First 15 committed steps: `INITIALIZING` skip. |
| `scientific_baseline.py` | Rule / code fingerprints | Copy constants as model-version identity. |
| `adaptive_pipeline`, `sdx_client`, CLI, CSV writers | Orchestration / SDX | **Do not port.** P-03 host replaces them. |

Do **not** port into the hot path:

- Unbounded `emissions`, `adaptation_audit`, `feedback_audit`, `trace_records`, `_rows` (SADE already has a retain_diagnostics opt-in; Go production keeps counters only).
- Pricing `pipeline.py` full-history refits (O(n²)). If pricing is added later, compute **only the current index**.
- JSON+SHA-256 of the entire emission four times per bar as a requirement. Keep `market_snapshot_id` from P-02; hash a small identity payload if an `observation_id` is still needed.

Warm-up: after 15 accepted finalized bars the 16th can be `ACTIONABLE`. That is ~16 minutes of eligible IEX prints, independent of the 64-bar observe window.

## 7. Output contract — `DecisionEvent`

Every finalized input that the host considers produces **exactly one** terminal `DecisionEvent`. Prefer a decision-or-skip union. Do not put `skipped=true` on a vector that also has `side=BUY`.

```text
DecisionEvent
  event_id              one per terminal outcome (immutable)
  signal_id             one per evaluated model step (INITIALIZING included)
  decision_id           only for BUY / SELL / HOLD
  symbol, interval_start, market_snapshot_id
  accepted_sequence
  received_at, completed_at, latency
  model_version, schema_version
  pre_state_hash, post_state_hash
  outcome = decision | skip
```

**Decision** (model status `ACTIONABLE`):

| Field | Type / range | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `side` | BUY, SELL, HOLD | yes |
| `confidence` / capturability `C` | `[0, 1]` | yes |
| `H` | 0 or 1 | yes |
| `Q_G`, `Q_S`, `Q_R` | `[0, 1]` | yes |
| `path_direction` | UPWARD, DOWNWARD, FLAT | yes |
| `model_status` | ACTIONABLE | yes |
| `emitter_position_state` | FLAT, LONG, SHORT | diagnostic only |

HOLD is a **decision**. `emitter_position_state` is frozen SADE context, not P-05/P-08 position.

**Skip** (no `decision_id`):

| Reason | Typical cause |
| :--- | :--- |
| `INFER_OFF` | Global Phase 0 infer false |
| `NOT_MODEL_ELIGIBLE` | Partial, reconstructed, not complete |
| `INITIALIZING` | Accepted step, context not yet 15 |
| `DUPLICATE_OR_REGRESSION` | `IntervalStart` ≤ last |
| `INPUT_GAP` | Proven missing eligible observation (not a skipped IEX minute) |
| `QUEUE_OVERFLOW` | Model mailbox would drop |
| `TIMEOUT` | Step exceeded deadline; state not committed |
| `INVALID_INPUT` | Non-finite / domain check |
| `ENGINE_ERROR` | Scientific failure |
| `ENGINE_PANIC` | Recovered panic |
| `STATE_DISCONTINUOUS` | Symbol quarantined after proven loss (overflow / panic / INPUT_GAP) |

`INITIALIZING` is an evaluated non-actionable outcome (has `signal_id`, no `decision_id`). Gate skips may omit `signal_id` only if the engine never ran; still require `event_id`.

ID invariants: unique within the process instance. A duplicate input yields a new skip event (`DUPLICATE_OR_REGRESSION`), not a replay of the prior decision. Upstream IDs on a decision must survive later P-05/P-06 unchanged.

Duplicate/contradictory proto (`side` + `skipped`) is forbidden. Freeze these domain types **before** Phase E proto.

### 7.1 State transaction and deadline

`AdaptiveEngine.Step` is a transaction:

```text
validate bar and time
copy / read immutable pre-state
calculate D01 → D02 → D04 → emitter
validate outputs
if wall time > deadline: discard work, emit TIMEOUT, do not commit
else atomically commit post-state
emit one DecisionEvent
```

- Commit is all-or-nothing. Timeout, error, and panic must not leave a half-updated engine.
- `context.WithTimeout` around a synchronous `Step` does **not** stop the CPU. Compute on a copy (or commit only after success). Do not leave a goroutine mutating committed state after TIMEOUT.
- No second `Step` for the same symbol concurrently.
- Deadline: **200 ms** from accept to outcome. A breach is a **model-health defect**, not routine shedding. Do not use a lossy queue as flow control.

Acceptance: a slow step that mutates after the deadline must yield exactly one `TIMEOUT`, no Decision for that interval, unchanged committed state hash.

### 7.2 Model version

`model_version` is a printable SHA-256 over a canonical JSON object (sorted keys) containing:

- schema version string (e.g. `quantram.adaptive.v1`)
- SADE baseline rule fingerprint and implementation fingerprint
- every D01/D02/D04/emitter constant that can change a decision (config structs, `CONTEXT_LENGTH`, clamps, decision predicate)
- operation-order identity (named step list)
- Go module path + version; git commit if available
- if the working tree is dirty or commit is unknown: suffix `+dirty` or `+unknown` — still valid, but live evidence must show it

Change the fingerprint when an equation, order, clamp, threshold, or warm-up rule changes. Do not include build-host, timestamp, or race-detector flags.

## 8. State, health, session

Per symbol, retain only:

- D01 `RuntimeState`
- deque of 15 completed context records
- `emitter_position_state`, `previous_decision`, `completed_count`, `last_interval_start`
- counters, not histories

Optional: bounded diagnostic ring **only** when explicitly enabled for local validation.

### 8.1 Session reset (Phase 0)

DI-04 is open. Until a calendar exists:

- process restart resets all model state (cold start)
- `infer=false` **pauses** without reset
- **no** automatic daily or “market open” reset from the local clock
- any operator reset is explicit and must emit an audit/skip event (`STATE_DISCONTINUOUS` or a dedicated reset reason)
- extended-hours bars are whatever P-02/Alpaca deliver; P-03 does not invent RTH filters

### 8.2 Model health

Per-symbol status: `off` | `cold` | `initializing` | `ready` | `paused` | `discontinuous` | `error`.

Also expose: accepted-step count, warm-up `n/16`, last received/accepted interval, last DecisionEvent time and outcome, last skip reason, consecutive errors/timeouts, mailbox depth, model version, pre/post hashes when diagnostics are on.

Aggregate:

| Component | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Healthy** | Host enabled; no discontinuous/error symbol; last eligible input finished within deadline |
| **Degraded** | Any symbol initializing, paused, lagging, or recently skipped for operational reasons |
| **Unavailable** | Host failed to start, baseline/config invalid, or every enabled engine is terminally failed |

Initialization is not an error; it must be visible. Panic/error on one symbol must not stop other symbols or P-02.

### 8.3 Provenance and replay (Phase 0 boundary)

`market_snapshot_id` + `model_version` are necessary and **not** sufficient for DI-07. D01 depends on prior state and the 15-context.

Phase 0 **can** reproduce: frozen Unit Run 001 fixtures (input SHA-256 + expected output + SADE revision), plus per-event `accepted_sequence` and pre/post state hashes.

Phase 0 **cannot** claim production replay of a live IEX session after process restart. Durable decision-input recording belongs to the later recording plane. Do not advertise MV-01 closed for live trading.

## 9. Equivalence (MV-01 for this increment)

A live IEX decision is not “the SADE model” until the Go box matches Python on a **frozen OHLCV sequence**.

Required fixtures (checked in):

- input CSV/JSON with origin note and SHA-256
- expected output with SADE revision / fingerprints
- per-field tolerance table (not only “small ulp”)
- exact match for `model_status`, `path_direction`, `side` / `position_decision`, and decision counts
- first-divergence report: symbol, sequence, field, expected, actual, pre-step hash
- deterministic repeated runs; `go test -race` on the engine

If a 1-ulp `C` vs median(C₁₅) flips `side`, treat it as a blocker; do not widen tolerance.

Do **not** require live IEX prices to match Unit Run 001.

## 9.1 Definition of done (adaptive increment)

- Frozen Unit Run 001 matches under the tolerance matrix.
- Every considered finalized input produces exactly one DecisionEvent.
- Partial, reconstructed head, duplicate, regressive, or unknown-quality bars do not mutate committed state.
- A missing eligible bar cannot pass silently; the symbol pauses or is discontinuous.
- Per-symbol work is ordered, isolated, race-free, and bounded.
- Timeout / error / panic / shutdown cannot partially commit state.
- Cold-start warm-up is deterministic and visible (`INITIALIZING n/16`).
- Global `infer` Phase 0 policy is explicit and tested (pause, not reset).
- Model version and `market_snapshot_id` accompany every evaluated outcome.
- Health distinguishes off / initializing / ready / paused / discontinuous / failed.
- `QUANTRAM_MODEL=off` leaves ingestion unchanged.
- `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` pass.
- A regular-hours live run crosses warm-up and records decisions/skips with latency — pass on domain fields (`model_status`, `side` or `skip_reason`), not a log substring. **Observed 1 Sep** on IEX (HOLD then BUY; Adaptive Pipeline in `quantram-dashboard`).
- No P-03 output is connected to orders.

## 10. Explicitly out of increment

- P-05 risk, P-06 paper orders, ledger, benchmark
- Joining adaptive output to PriceEngine in **this** P-03 increment — moved to [P-04](QuanTRAM_P04_PRICE_ENGINE_090226.md) (Phases A–I landed 2 Sep; BUY/SELL+color join remains out of P-04)
- Databento, SIP, tick aggregation
- Azure / AKS sharding
- Dashboard BUY/SELL candlestick markers and durable decision history (the Adaptive Pipeline **process viewer** landed 1 Sep in `quantram-dashboard`; Price Engine cards and airport boards landed 2 Sep)

## 11. Change log

| Date | Change |
| :--- | :--- |
| August 31, 2026 | Initial P-03 design: Go adaptive box, P-02 finalized input, no SDX, no adaptive Python sidecar. |
| August 31, 2026 | Recorded APTF→SADE incomplete lift: intended decision is adaptive + PriceEngine on RK45 trajectories; Go analysis predates finished RK45 Python migration. |
| August 31, 2026 | RK45 recorded as the scientific authority (golden nugget) for the PriceEngine decision; expm is an optional match to that cover, not a substitute definition. |
| August 31, 2026 | Incorporated `P03_feedback_083126.md`: model delivery (no silent drop), cold start, global infer Phase 0, transactional Step, DecisionEvent, IntervalStart event time, health/replay/DoD. |
| August 31, 2026 | Phases A–C landed: collocated Go D01→D02→D04→emitter, `DecisionEvent` domain types, Unit Run 001 equivalence. Phase D0 / host / proto still open. |
| August 31, 2026 | Superseded RK45-as-destination: Go production PriceEngine uses EXPM only (`time_term == false`; reject `true`). Frozen Python RK45 is the Gold Nugget validation oracle, not a Go runtime or called solver. Finding 001: 55 solves / 605 points; downstream equivalence passed. |
| August 31, 2026 | RK45 lineage recorded: APTF `run_test_013b_qqq_validation.py::solve_cover` → SADE `projection.py::solve_cover_rk45_reference`. Go validation uses the SADE frozen reference only; no APTF repository dependency. |
| September 1, 2026 | Phase D0: `Pipeline.SubscribeModelBars` is the P-03 input. Overflow/gap mark the symbol discontinuous; observe `SubscribeFinalized` remains lossy. |
| September 1, 2026 | Phase D: keyed `internal/modelhost`, 200 ms `PrepareStep`/`Commit` deadline, infer pause-not-reset, panic isolation, config validation, `GetHealth` model component. Default `off`. Proto still Phase E. |
| September 1, 2026 | Phase E: `ModelService.StreamDecisions` (`oneof` decision \| skip). |
